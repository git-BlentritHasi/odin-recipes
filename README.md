# My HTML Recipe Project

Hey! This is my HTML recipe project, where I'm building a basic recipe website. I've created an index page with links to different recipesâ€”nothing fancy yet, focusing on the HTML skills. Each recipe page has details like ingredients and instructions. Don't judge the look; we'll style it up later with CSS. Excited to keep learning!
